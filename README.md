# Fast-Food
Ted Fast food

An ordering system for a take-away food shop.  A GUI menu takes input from the operator (menu items are chosen from a series of drop-down lists, including quantity)
and interacts with an array of food items.  Each order has a space for entering the name associated with the order. The program stores orders in an array.
The program allows for take-away and delivery orders and calculates the final cost of the order.  The menu drives all aspects of the ordering system.
